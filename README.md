# Hydrogen-based Project

This project is initiated using Shopify's Hydrogen template for headless commerce. Hydrogen is Shopify’s innovative stack for headless commerce, designed to work seamlessly with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopify’s full-stack web framework. This template provides a **minimal setup** to kickstart your coding test with Hydrogen.
